This lightweight Homey device application adds Tasmota devices support through MQTT protocol. It uses Menno van Grinsven's MQTT Client to communicate with an MQTT broker, so the client should be already installed and configured.
The current version of the application supports on/off capability for single or multiple sockets devices, power monitoring, dim, light_temperature, light_hue, and light_saturation capabilities for single socket devices.
