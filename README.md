# Tasmota MQTT

This is lightweight Homey device application adds tasmota devices support through MQTT protocol. It uses  Menno van Grinsven's <a href="https://homey.app/en-au/app/nl.scanno.mqtt/MQTT-Client/">MQTT Client</a> to communicate with MQTT broker, so client should be already installed and configured.
Current version of application (v 0.2.0) supports only onoff capability for single or multiple sockets devices.
